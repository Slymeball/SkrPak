# The Skript Pack!
Also known as **SkrPak**. Created by **Edb** *(MCJ _Edb/sl_me)*

The SkrPak is a collection of simple yet useful skripts for anyone starting out with Skript. It could also be used as a starting point for skripts.

## The pack includes skripts such as...
- A gamemode switcher (/gm).
  - Go to the [Wiki](https://github.com/the3dbb/SkrPak/wiki/Gamemode-Switcher) for more information about the /gm command.
- Time control.
- Join/Leave messages.
- A chat control-like skript.
- A playtime command.
  - Playtime might be an inefficent skript for unpowered servers since it loops through the lists of players each second.

More skripts might come at a later time. If you'd like to, you can stay updated with the project.
