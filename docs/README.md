SkrPak is intended to be used by beginners to learn what stuff does. It goes over most everything you need, from variables to loops. It can also be used as a starting point for servers needing a quick gamemode switcher similar to that of Essentials.

## Features
The pack includes skripts such as...
- A gamemode switcher you're already familiar with.
- Time Management (for when you REALLY want daytime).
- Custom Join/Leave messages.
- A fair amount of CHC (Chat Control).
- Playtimes
  - Some servers might struggle due to the constant looping.

Some more Skripts may come at a later date.
